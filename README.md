# Utilizing transformers on short sentence topic modeling
This repository contains scripts and tools for text analysis research, focusing on reflection datasets annotated by multiple individuals. 
The workflow includes dataset preparation, preprocessing, fine-tuning transformer-based models, and clustering using embeddings.

## Dependencies
pandas
openpyxl
numpy
torch
nltk
transformers
scikit-learn
seaborn
matplotlib
datasets

## Codes
1. Dataset Preparation Scripts
- prepare_dataset.py
  : Prepares the dataset using rare reflection data annotated by multiple people.

2. Utility Scripts
- data_preprocessing.py
  : Contains preprocessing data for text and data preparation.
- functions.py
  : Utility functions used across the fine-tuning and clustering workflows.

3. Main Scripts
- finetune_model_bert.py
  : Trains a transformer-based model (BERT) on the reflection dataset to generate embeddings for downstream tasks.
- clustering.py
  : Performs clustering using the embeddings generated by the transformer model.
